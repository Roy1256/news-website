<h1>India Is Quietly Building the Brain of Its Future Fighter Jets</h1>
<p class="article-meta">By Gurudev Mandal | IntellectualOnly</p>

<p>India is quietly preparing for a future where air wars will not be won only by faster jets or heavier weapons, but by how intelligent and precise an aircraft really is. In a major strategic step, the Defence Research and Development Organisation, through its advanced avionics laboratory Research Centre Imarat in Hyderabad, has invited private companies and deep-tech startups to co-develop quantum avionics for India’s future sixth-generation fighter jets.</p>

<p>This move clearly shows that India wants to build the brain of the aircraft before building the body.</p>

<p>Quantum avionics means using the laws of quantum physics to create navigation and sensing systems that are far more accurate and resilient than anything used today. Modern fighter jets depend heavily on GPS and satellite signals, but in real combat these signals can be jammed, spoofed, or completely denied.</p>

<p>Quantum inertial navigation changes this equation. Instead of relying on satellites, it tracks the motion of atoms inside the aircraft itself. By observing atomic behavior during acceleration, turns, and maneuvers, the system calculates position with extreme precision. Experts believe navigation errors could be limited to just a few centimetres even after hours of flight without satellite support.</p>

<p>This allows fighter jets to operate deep inside enemy territory, fully effective in GPS-denied environments.</p>

<p>This is where Raman-Driven Spin Noise Spectroscopy (RDSNS) becomes critical. RDSNS allows scientists to observe tiny fluctuations in the spin of atoms and electrons without disturbing the system. These fluctuations contain vital information about magnetic fields and quantum stability.</p>

<p>By reading spin noise without interference, RDSNS enables engineers to evaluate how stable, clean, and sensitive a quantum sensor truly is.</p>

<p>RDSNS directly strengthens quantum magnetometry. Quantum magnetometers detect extremely small changes in Earth’s magnetic field. Any large metal object — a submarine underwater or an explosive buried underground — slightly disturbs this field.</p>

<p>With RDSNS-enhanced sensors, these disturbances can be detected from high altitude with much greater accuracy. Installed on a fighter jet, this effectively turns the aircraft into an advanced intelligence-gathering platform capable of detecting threats invisible to radar or cameras.</p>

<p>Another frontier linked to quantum avionics is quantum radar and quantum lidar. Traditional stealth aircraft evade classical radar by scattering or absorbing radar waves. Quantum radar concepts use entangled photons and quantum correlations to detect signals conventional systems miss.</p>

<p>Even partial success in this area could fundamentally change the balance between stealth and detection in future air combat.</p>

<p>What makes this initiative especially significant is Research Centre Imarat’s decision to involve private industry at an early stage. Quantum systems usually operate in controlled laboratory environments. Fighter jets face extreme vibration, high G-forces, rapid temperature shifts, and intense electromagnetic interference.</p>

<p>Techniques like RDSNS help scientists understand how quantum sensors behave under stress, enabling the design of rugged, combat-ready hardware.</p>

<p>DRDO’s goal is to ensure quantum avionics do not remain trapped in laboratories for decades. These systems are intended to integrate with artificial intelligence, sensor-fusion software, and unmanned combat drones.</p>

<p>In sixth-generation warfare, a fighter jet will act as a flying command node — controlling drones, processing massive data streams, and making rapid decisions in contested environments.</p>

<p>There is also a strategic dimension. Nations such as the United States and China are investing heavily in quantum sensing and spin-based technologies. By developing indigenous quantum avionics and core techniques like RDSNS, India reduces dependence on foreign suppliers for its most sensitive defence systems.</p>

<p>Challenges remain. Quantum avionics must prove reliability, affordability, and maintainability under combat conditions. But by opening core programs to private industry, DRDO is signaling confidence that these challenges can be overcome.</p>

<p>In future wars, dominance will belong to aircraft that can navigate without satellites, detect the unseen, survive electronic attack, and read quantum signals faster than their adversaries.</p>

<p>Quantum avionics, supported by technologies like Raman-Driven Spin Noise Spectroscopy, may never be visible from the outside — but they could become the silent force behind India’s sixth-generation fighter jets.</p>
