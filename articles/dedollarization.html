<h1>Why the World Is Quietly Moving Away from the Dollar</h1>
<p class="article-meta">By Gurudev Mandal | IntellectualOnly</p>

<p>For more than seventy years, one currency stood above all others.</p>

<p>The US dollar was not just a medium of exchange. It was the backbone of global power.</p>

<p>Oil was priced in dollars. Trade moved through dollars. National reserves were held in dollars. Control over the dollar meant control over global finance, global stability, and global pressure.</p>

<p>This system did not happen by accident. It was built after the Second World War, when the United States emerged as the world’s dominant economic and military power. Over time, the dollar became the foundation of the global order.</p>

<p>But history shows that no system based on absolute dominance lasts forever.</p>

<p>Quietly, steadily, the world has begun to shift.</p>

<p>Today, leaders across continents are asking a question that once seemed unthinkable. What happens when the global economy depends on a currency controlled by one nation?</p>

<p>That question lies at the heart of de-dollarization.</p>

<p>De-dollarization is not a revolution. It is a slow, strategic retreat from risk.</p>

<p>It does not mean abandoning the dollar. It means reducing exposure to it. Reducing vulnerability. Reducing the power of any single country to influence global outcomes through financial control.</p>

<p>The turning point came when money stopped being neutral.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, the US dollar increasingly became a geopolitical weapon. Sanctions were imposed not only on governments, but on banks, companies, shipping networks, and even central bank reserves. Entire economies could be pressured without a single soldier crossing a border.</p>

<p>At first, many countries accepted this reality.</p>

<p>Later, many feared it.</p>

<p>This fear was not limited to America’s rivals. Even US allies began to express concern. French President Emmanuel Macron openly warned that Europe could not claim strategic autonomy while remaining dependent on a foreign currency for its economic survival. Sovereignty and monetary dependence cannot coexist forever.</p>

<p>Then came a moment that fundamentally altered global thinking.</p>

<p>When foreign exchange reserves — accumulated over decades — were frozen overnight, governments around the world understood a brutal truth. If reserves can be seized, then they are not truly reserves. They are permissions.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin later described the weaponization of the dollar as a strategic mistake that would accelerate global efforts to bypass it. While his position was expected, the global reaction was what truly mattered.</p>

<p>Even inside Washington, warning signs were raised.</p>

<p>Former US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cautioned that overusing financial sanctions could weaken the dollar’s central role. Years later, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed similar concerns, openly acknowledging that excessive reliance on sanctions creates incentives to reduce dollar dependence.</p>

<p>Then came the Trump era.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s “America First” policy reshaped global trade. Tariffs were imposed on allies and rivals alike. Trade wars replaced trade agreements. Predictability — the foundation of trust — weakened.</p>

<p>If US policy could swing so sharply with one election, then depending entirely on the dollar carried political risk, not just economic risk.</p>

<p>This is where India’s role becomes crucial.</p>

<p>India does not confront the dollar. It hedges against it.</p>

<p>India’s move toward rupee-based trade settlements reflects strategic autonomy — creating options, insurance against shocks, and flexibility in an uncertain world.</p>

<p>India trades with the West, engages with the East, and balances relationships without locking its future to one currency or one power.</p>

<p>Alongside India stands BRICS.</p>

<p>BRICS is not driven by ideology. It is driven by experience.</p>

<p>China has called for reforms in global financial governance. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva has openly questioned why global trade must depend on the dollar at all.</p>

<p>These are not emotional statements. They are strategic signals.</p>

<p>Local currency trade is expanding quietly. Gold reserves are rising steadily. Alternative payment systems are developing. Energy deals are experimenting beyond dollar pricing.</p>

<p>So, is the US dollar finished?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>The dollar remains deeply embedded in global finance. But its dominance is no longer absolute — and no longer unquestioned.</p>

<p>What we are witnessing is not collapse, but transition.</p>

<p>A gradual movement toward a multipolar financial order.</p>

<p>In a world where money equals power, no nation wants its future controlled by someone else’s currency.</p>
